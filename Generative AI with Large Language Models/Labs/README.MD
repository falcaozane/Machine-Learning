* FLAN-T5: FLAN-T5 is a general-purpose language model designed for various tasks, including summarization, which will be used to process dialogue datasets.
* Zero-shot Inference: Zero-shot inference refers to the model's ability to generate outputs without prior examples, relying solely on the provided prompt.
* Hugging Face Transformers: A library that provides pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing tasks, including the FLAN-T5 model used in this lab.
* Prompt Engineering: Prompt engineering involves crafting specific instructions to guide the model's output, significantly impacting the quality of generated summaries.
* One-shot and Few-shot Inference: One-shot and few-shot inference involve providing the model with one or more examples of correct outputs to improve its performance on new tasks.
